This was my first finished coding project ever!  
It took a bit longer than I had hoped but I think it turned out well.  
I wanted to create something interactive, that you could play with, so I decided to try to make like a storybook type game - a choose your own adventure game!
It's about someone waking up in a forest, and trying to get enough rubies to get home.  
It's a pretty simple game, but as a first project, I'm happy with it.
